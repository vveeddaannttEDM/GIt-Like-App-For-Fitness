# GIt-Like-App-For-Fitness
I want to construct a git like profile app for gym bros , so they can see how much progress they are gonna able to make throughout the period , so the color of a day will be determined by two things a workout program that is available on google sheets and a nutrition app which counts calories , protein intake google sheets of a program can be uploaded by the user , our app connects to the google sheet and users have to mark a specific day exercises as green , yellow or red ,based on this data we are gonna take this to construct our final progress
